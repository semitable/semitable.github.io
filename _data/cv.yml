      institution: NVIDIA
      year: 2022 (Summer)
      description:
        - Worked with the Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) research group. The project involved reasoning with occlusions. We developed a method for generating plausible vehicle trajectories in occluded spaces with a variational autoencoder and including them in a downstream planning pipeline.
        - My work on reasoning with occlusions was published in ICRA 2023.

        - Marked assignment and final exams.

    - title: Research Assistant
      institution: ENECIA
      year: 2017 - 2018
      description:
        - Developed tools for smart cities, including power-consumption prediction models, and policies for electric vehicle charging. Part of my work has been peer-reviewed and published in journals.
        - I was responsible for system administration tasks for cloud infrastructure (AWS), including management of computing resources and databases.

    - title: Game Developer
      institution: 
      year: 2015 - 2017
      description:
        - I led the development of a sci-fi strategy video game. My work included C++ coding with which I programmed procedural creation of 3D meshes, simulations of planet tectonics and climate, and the game's artificial intelligence.
        - Developed two profitable projects that were released in the Unreal Engine Marketplace.

- title: Areas of Expertise
  type: list
  contents:
    - "My PhD research is in the area of Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning. In particular, I study how multiple agents can benefit from homogeneity and efficiently explore in environments with sparse rewards. My main research interests are: Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Multi-Agent Systems, Deep Learning, Unsupervised Learning."
    - "I am interested in both single and multi-agent applications of reinforcement learning; the application of deep networks and deep learning in reinforcement learning; and the use of unsupervised learning (e.g. variational auto-encoders) for opponent modelling, or learning state representations."
    - "I have worked with several programming languages including (but not limited to): Python, C, C++, MATLAB, JavaScript"
    - "In my work I have extensively used the following technologies and frameworks: PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy, Amazon Web Services (AWS), OpenAI's Gym, MongoDB, pandas, Git."
    - "I have also been performing Linux system administration tasks (e.g. Bash scripting, security, Slurm cluster management, webhosting support, and more)."
