Previously at [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) and [NVIDIA Research](https://nvr-avg.github.io/). 

I completed my PhD in the [CDT for Robotics and Autonomous Agents](https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/), advised by [Stefano Albrecht](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/stefano-albrecht/) in the ([University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics)) as a member of the [Autonomous Agents Research Group](https://agents.inf.ed.ac.uk/). 

I am working on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning. I am co-author of the [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Foundations and Modern Approaches](http://www.marl-book.com) textbook which serves as an introduction to MARL. Online version of the book is available for free!
I am also the maintainer of the book's code base found here: [fast-marl](https://github.com/marl-book/fast-marl).

I also authored and maintain the [Multi-Robot Warehouse](https://www.github.com/semitable/robotic-warehouse) environment for multi-agent RL research, and the Python version of [Level-based Foraging](https://www.github.com/semitable/lb-foraging). Finally, I am a co-author of [E-PyMARL](https://github.com/uoe-agents/epymarl), a library for MARL which has been widely used by the community.

Keywords: Machine Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), Multi-agent Systems, Exploration in RL.
